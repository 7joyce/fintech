this repository will showcase my fintech skill

Hi, my name is Joyce Zhang. I am currently in sales, marketing, and design consulting. Previously I studied Biology and Chinese at the University of Texas at Austin, USA. In my downtime, I like to take on modeling and acting gigs to connect with more creative brains. 
My career goal is to be able to create a tech-savvy marketing business to help bridge the gap of communication between tech startups and their customers. 
I believe Fintech is a cost-effective way for me to understand a variety of useful technology, and also get up to speed in the financial world.
